NOTES LOGIC BEHIND EVERYTHING
INFIX TO POSTFIX
1-If we get any char then we straight up insert as all +- symbols go at the end
2-IF we get any opening bracket then we insert it
3-If we get any closing bracket we pop all the bw of opening and closing bracket
4-If we encounter any operators then we see the precedence and
if PRECEDENCE of ch <= st.top() then we pop else insert
example * < + this is not true hence stack + *
example + < * this is true hence stack +
5- While stack is not empty empty the stack and get the ans

INFIX TO PREFIX
1-We reverse the string and change the brackets direction
2- Apply inifx to postfix with
3- One changed condition PRECEDENCE of ch < st.top()
4- Reverse the ans

POSTFIX TO INFIX
1- start from beginning as operators end mai honge
2- if any operand then push in stack
ab+ ko a+b
stack - | a b + op2 + op1
3- op2 operator op1 when op1 = first element of stack and op2 = second element of stack

1 - start from last as operators opening mai honge
